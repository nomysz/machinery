# Machinery

**Machinery** is a **dead simple game engine toolkit** written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

It started as a small piece of my fun gamedev project.

It provides definitions of **vectors**, **polygons** and **rigid bodies** as well as utilities around it like **operations on vectors and polygons**, **collision detection and resolution** based on SAT (Separating Axis Theory), **concept of physical world** linking it all together or number randomisation.

Due to it's modular nature it's simple to combine it with any [rendering framework](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) and create your own game or simulation.

## How to use

I would recommend a fork or the good old copy-paste method into your own game project.
