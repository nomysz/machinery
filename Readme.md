# Machinery

**Machinery** is a **dead simple game engine toolkit** written in Go.

It started as a small piece of my fun gamedev project.

It provides definitions of **vectors**, **polygons** and **rigid bodies** as well as utilities like **operations on vectors and polygons** and **collision detection and resolution** based on SAT (separating axis theory).

Due to it's modular nature it's simple to combine it with any rendering framework and create your own game or simulation.

## How to use

I would recommend a fork or the good old copy-paste method into your own game project.
